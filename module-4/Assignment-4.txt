K-Means Clustering

Objective: To apply k-means clustering to real-world data.

Task:
In this assignment, students will work with a dataset of their choice, apply k-means clustering using R, and explore techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters. They will visualize the clustered data and centroids, interpret the results, and discuss practical applications of k-means clustering.

Instructions:

Dataset Selection: Instruct students to select a dataset with multiple features (variables) that could potentially exhibit natural clusters. Encourage them to consider real-world datasets related to their interests or domains of study.

K-Means Clustering: Ask students to perform k-means clustering on the selected dataset using R. They should use the kmeans function or relevant packages (e.g., stats, cluster) for this task.

Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters: Introduce students to methods for determining the optimal number of clusters. Suggest the use of the elbow method, silhouette method, or any other suitable technique. They should experiment with different numbers of clusters and choose the most appropriate one based on the chosen method.

Visualization: Instruct students to visualize the clustered data points and centroids. They can create scatter plots or other relevant visualizations to illustrate how data points are grouped into clusters.

Interpretation: Encourage students to interpret the results of the k-means clustering. They should discuss the characteristics of each cluster and explore whether the clustering aligns with their initial expectations.

Practical Applications: Ask students to identify potential real-world applications or use cases for k-means clustering based on their findings. They should discuss how the clustering results could be applied in practice.

Documentation: Students should document their entire analysis, including code, visualizations, interpretations, and discussions. The documentation should be well-structured and clear.

Submission: Students should submit their R code/script and a written report (PDF or Word document) that includes visualizations and explanations of the k-means clustering results.
