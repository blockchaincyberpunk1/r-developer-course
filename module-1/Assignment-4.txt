Introduction to R Functions

Objective: To practice creating and using functions in R.

Task:
In this assignment, students will practice creating custom R functions to perform specific data analysis tasks. They will be presented with a set of data analysis tasks and will be required to create functions to address those tasks. Additionally, they will apply these functions to a dataset and provide the results.

Instructions:

Provide students with a dataset (in a downloadable format, e.g., CSV) that they will use for this assignment. The dataset should be suitable for the data analysis tasks.

Present a list of data analysis tasks to the students, such as:
a. Calculate the mean (average) of a numeric variable in the dataset.
b. Calculate the standard deviation of a numeric variable.
c. Normalize a numeric variable (e.g., scale it to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1).
d. Create a function to filter rows based on specific criteria (e.g., filter rows where a variable is above a certain threshold).
e. Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum) for a numeric variable.
f. Perform a data transformation (e.g., log transformation) on a numeric variable.

Instruct students to create custom R functions to address these data analysis tasks. Each task should be associated with a separate function. The functions should be appropriately named and include clear documentation (comments) explaining their purpose and usage.

Ask students to load the provided dataset into R using appropriate functions or packages.

Instruct students to apply the custom functions they've created to the dataset and display the results. They should ensure that the functions work correctly and produce the expected outcomes.

Encourage students to test their functions on different datasets or variable names to ensure versatility and robustness.

Emphasize the importance of writing efficient and well-documented functions for future use.

Set a deadline for students to complete the tasks and submit their R script containing the functions and the code demonstrating their application.

Optionally, you can provide sample datasets and expected results for some tasks to facilitate self-assessment.

Submission:

After completing the tasks, students should submit their R script containing the custom functions and the code demonstrating their application to the dataset through the course's assignment submission portal.
