R and Basic Statistics

Objective: To apply statistical concepts using R.

Task:
In this assignment, students will apply statistical concepts using the R programming language. They will be provided with a dataset and will perform various statistical analyses, including calculating basic statistical measures, conducting hypothesis tests, and visualizing data distributions to draw conclusions.

Instructions:

Provide students with a dataset (in a downloadable format, e.g., CSV) that they will use for this assignment. The dataset should contain relevant data for statistical analysis.

Instruct students to perform the following tasks on the dataset:
a. Calculate basic statistical measures: Ask students to calculate measures such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and quartiles for one or more numeric variables in the dataset. They should use appropriate R functions for these calculations.

b. Conduct hypothesis tests: Assign students specific hypothesis testing tasks based on the dataset. Examples include:

Performing a t-test to compare means of two groups.
Conducting a chi-squared test for independence to analyze categorical data.
Conducting correlation tests to determine relationships between variables.
Choosing appropriate statistical tests based on the nature of the data and the research questions.
c. Visualize data distributions: Instruct students to create meaningful visualizations of the data. They can use R packages like ggplot2 for creating plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to visualize data distributions and relationships between variables.

Emphasize the importance of documenting their analysis process and providing clear explanations of the results and conclusions drawn from the statistical analyses.

Encourage students to comment their R code to explain each step of the analysis and interpretation.

Set a deadline for students to complete the tasks and submit their R script/code, along with a written report summarizing their findings and insights.

Optionally, provide guidelines for formatting and presenting statistical results in their written reports.

Submission:

After completing the tasks, students should submit their R script/code and a written report (PDF or Word document) summarizing their statistical analysis, findings, and insights through the course's assignment submission portal.
