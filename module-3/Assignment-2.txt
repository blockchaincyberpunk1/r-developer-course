Hypothesis Testing

Objective: To perform hypothesis testing and understand p-values.

Task:
In this assignment, students will apply hypothesis testing techniques in R to test a research question using a provided dataset. They will formulate null and alternative hypotheses, conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., t-test, chi-squared test) in R, calculate p-values, draw conclusions based on the results, and interpret the practical significance of their findings.

Instructions:

Provide students with a research question and a dataset that is relevant to the research question. Ensure that the dataset is suitable for hypothesis testing (e.g., contains categorical or numeric variables of interest).

Instruct students to perform the following tasks using R:
a. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses based on the research question. Clearly state what is being tested and what the expected outcome is.

b. Choose an appropriate hypothesis test based on the nature of the data and the research question. Common tests include:

Two-sample t-test for comparing means of two groups.
Chi-squared test for testing associations between categorical variables.
One-sample t-test for comparing a sample mean to a population mean.
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-parametric data.
c. Conduct the selected hypothesis test in R using appropriate functions or packages.

d. Calculate p-values for the tests. Ensure that students understand the concept of p-values and their interpretation in hypothesis testing.

Ask students to draw conclusions based on the calculated p-values. They should decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis and provide reasons for their decisions.

Encourage students to interpret the practical significance of their findings. Are the results of the hypothesis test practically meaningful? What implications do the findings have for the research question?

Challenge students to consider the limitations and assumptions of the chosen hypothesis test and discuss how these might impact the results and conclusions.

Set a deadline for students to complete the tasks and submit their R code, along with a written report explaining their hypotheses, the hypothesis test used, the p-values, and their conclusions.

Submission:

Students should submit their R script/code and the written report (PDF or Word document) through the course's assignment submission portal.
