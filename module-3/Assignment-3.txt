Confidence Intervals

Objective: To compute confidence intervals using R.

Task:
In this assignment, students will practice calculating confidence intervals for specific parameters using a provided dataset in R. They will select a parameter (e.g., population mean, proportion) to estimate, calculate the confidence interval, interpret the results, and explore how the confidence interval changes with different confidence levels.

Instructions:

Provide students with a dataset that is suitable for estimating a specific parameter (e.g., a dataset containing numeric or binary data).

Instruct students to perform the following tasks using R:
a. Choose a parameter of interest to estimate from the dataset. It could be the population mean, proportion, or another relevant parameter.

b. Select a confidence level (e.g., 95%, 90%, etc.) for constructing the confidence interval. Explain to students the concept of confidence levels and their significance in interval estimation.

c. Calculate the confidence interval for the chosen parameter using appropriate R functions or packages. Depending on the parameter, students may use functions like t.test() for means or prop.test() for proportions.

d. Interpret the results of the confidence interval. What does the interval tell us about the parameter? How confident can we be in our estimate?

Ask students to explore how the confidence interval changes with different confidence levels. They should repeat the calculation of confidence intervals for different levels (e.g., 90%, 99%) and compare the results. Encourage them to discuss the trade-offs between narrower and wider confidence intervals.

Challenge students to discuss the practical implications of their confidence interval calculations. How might decision-making or conclusions change based on the confidence intervals they have computed?

Encourage students to present their findings in a clear and concise written report, including details on the parameter estimated, confidence level chosen, calculation methods, interpretations, and discussions on the effects of changing confidence levels.

Set a deadline for students to complete the tasks and submit their R code and written report.

Submission:

Students should submit their R script/code and the written report (PDF or Word document) through the course's assignment submission portal.
