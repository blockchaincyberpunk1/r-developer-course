Reproducible Data Analysis

Objective: To practice creating reproducible data analysis projects.

Task:
In this assignment, students will build a complete and reproducible data analysis project using Jupyter Notebook (Python) or R Markdown (R). The goal is to emphasize the importance of clear documentation, version control, and code organization for reproducibility and collaboration in data analysis tasks.

Instructions:

Dataset and Analysis Task:
a. Instruct students to choose a dataset that is suitable for a data analysis task (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
b. Define a specific data analysis task or question that they aim to answer using the chosen dataset.

Data Analysis Workflow:
a. Guide students to develop a comprehensive data analysis workflow in either Jupyter Notebook (Python) or R Markdown (R).
b. The workflow should include the following components:

Data loading: Import the dataset into the notebook.
Data preprocessing: Clean, handle missing values, and format the data appropriately.
Data exploration: Generate visualizations and summary statistics to understand the data.
Model development: Apply appropriate machine learning or statistical techniques for the chosen task.
Model evaluation: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
Interpretation: Provide insights and conclusions based on the analysis results.
c. Encourage students to organize their code into sections or cells, adding explanations, comments, and markdown cells to make the analysis easy to follow.
Version Control with Git:
a. Ensure that students use Git for version control throughout the project.
b. They should make regular commits with clear and informative commit messages.
c. Emphasize the importance of branching for experimental work and merging changes back into the main project.

Documentation:
a. Instruct students to include a README file in the project directory that provides an overview of the project's purpose and how to reproduce the analysis.
b. Encourage them to add explanations and interpretations throughout the notebook, making it self-contained and understandable to others.

Code Quality:
a. Emphasize the significance of code readability and organization. Students should follow best practices for code structure and naming conventions.
b. Encourage them to use meaningful variable names and comments to explain complex or non-intuitive code segments.
