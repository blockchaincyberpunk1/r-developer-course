Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values

Objective: To practice data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.

Task:
In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in data cleaning and preprocessing. They will work with a real-world dataset containing missing values, duplicated records, and inconsistencies. The goal is to clean and prepare the data for subsequent analysis.

Instructions:

Dataset Selection:
a. Provide students with a dataset that includes missing values, duplicated records, and inconsistencies. Ensure that the dataset is relevant to real-world data analysis.
b. You can use publicly available datasets or create a custom dataset for this assignment.

Data Cleaning:
a. Instruct students to load the dataset into R.
b. Ask them to identify and handle missing values using appropriate techniques such as:

Imputation (e.g., mean, median, mode)
Removal of rows or columns with excessive missing values
c. Guide them in detecting and removing duplicated records.
d. Encourage students to address data inconsistencies, which may include:
Standardizing date formats
Converting categorical variables to a consistent format
Handling outliers
Documentation:
a. Require students to maintain detailed documentation of their data cleaning process. Each step should be clearly explained.
b. Ask them to document the reasons behind their decisions. For instance, why did they choose a particular imputation method or decide to remove certain records?
c. Emphasize the importance of creating reproducible and well-documented code.

Presentation:
a. Instruct students to present the cleaned dataset in a structured format. This can be in the form of an R script, R Markdown document, or Jupyter Notebook.
b. Encourage them to include summary statistics of the cleaned data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and counts.
c. Ask students to provide insights into the impact of data cleaning on subsequent analysis. Are there notable changes in data distribution or statistics after cleaning?
