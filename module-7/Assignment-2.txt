Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Clean Data

Objective: To perform EDA on cleaned data.

Task:
In this assignment, students will build upon the cleaned dataset from Assignment 1 and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). The objective is to gain insights into the data by creating visualizations, summarizing statistics, and identifying trends and patterns.

Instructions:

Cleaned Dataset:
a. Instruct students to use the cleaned dataset they prepared in Assignment 1.
b. Emphasize the importance of using a cleaned dataset to ensure the accuracy of EDA results.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
a. Ask students to load the cleaned dataset into R.
b. Guide them in conducting EDA, which may include the following steps:

Creating visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to explore the distribution of variables.
Calculating and visualizing summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for relevant variables.
Identifying and visualizing correlations between variables, using techniques like scatter plots or correlation matrices.
Exploring trends and patterns in the data, especially those that are relevant to the dataset's context.
Using appropriate visualization packages such as ggplot2 for creating insightful plots.
Insights and Hypotheses:
a. Instruct students to generate insights based on their EDA findings. What interesting patterns or trends have they discovered?
b. Encourage them to formulate hypotheses for further analysis. These hypotheses can be related to relationships between variables, potential predictors, or trends over time.
c. Emphasize the importance of critical thinking and data-driven decision-making in this phase.

Presentation:
a. Ask students to present their EDA findings in a well-structured report or presentation.
b. Require them to include visualizations, summary statistics, and key insights.
c. Encourage them to discuss the relevance of their findings to the dataset's domain and potential implications for future analysis.
