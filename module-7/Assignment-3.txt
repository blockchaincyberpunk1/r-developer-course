Data Version Control with Git

Objective: To introduce version control for data science projects.

Task:
In this assignment, students will learn the basics of data version control using Git. They will apply version control to a simple data analysis project, emphasizing the importance of tracking changes, collaboration, and maintaining project reproducibility.

Instructions:

Data Analysis Project:
a. Instruct students to create a simple data analysis project. This could be a Jupyter Notebook for Python or an R Markdown document for R.
b. Encourage them to include multiple versions of code files, data files, or both. For example, they could analyze a dataset, make changes to the analysis, or update the dataset over time.
c. Ensure that the project has clear data processing and analysis steps.

Git Repository Setup:
a. Teach students how to initiate a Git repository in the project's directory.
b. Explain the concepts of commits, branches, and merges in Git.
c. Instruct them on how to add and commit their project files to the Git repository.

Version Control Workflow:
a. Ask students to make a series of commits to track changes in their project. These commits should include explanations of what changes were made.
b. Guide them to create branches to work on different features or experiments in their project.
c. Show them how to merge branches back into the main project and resolve any conflicts that may arise.

Benefits of Version Control:
a. Encourage students to reflect on the benefits of using Git for data science projects. This may include:

Maintaining a history of changes for reproducibility.
Collaborating with team members by sharing the Git repository.
Isolating experimental work in branches without affecting the main project.
b. Ask them to provide real-world examples of when version control would be beneficial in data science projects.
Documentation:
a. Emphasize the importance of writing clear commit messages to describe changes.
b. Instruct students to include a README file in their project, explaining the purpose of the project, how to reproduce it, and how to use Git for version control.
