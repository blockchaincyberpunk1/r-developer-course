Collaborative Data Analysis with Git and GitHub

Objective: To collaborate on a data analysis project using Git and GitHub.

Task:
In this assignment, students will work in teams to perform a collaborative data analysis project using Git and GitHub. The objective is to simulate a real-world collaborative data analysis workflow, emphasizing version control, teamwork, and effective project management.

Instructions:

Team Formation:
a. Instruct students to form teams consisting of 2-4 members each.
b. Encourage diversity within teams to promote a variety of perspectives and skills.

Project Selection:
a. Each team should choose a collaborative data analysis project. The dataset and analysis task should be well-defined.
b. Ensure that the chosen project allows for different roles within the team, such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and documentation.

GitHub Repository:
a. Guide each team to create a shared Git repository on GitHub to store all project-related files, including code, data, and documentation.
b. Teams should choose one member to act as the repository owner or maintainer, responsible for setting up the repository and granting access to team members.
c. The repository should include a README file that describes the project, lists team members, and provides instructions for reproducing the analysis.

Role Assignment:
a. Within each team, assign roles to team members based on their strengths and interests.
b. Common roles may include data cleaning, EDA, modeling, visualization, and documentation.

Collaborative Development:
a. Instruct teams to use Git for collaborative development. Each team member should clone the shared repository to their local environment.
b. Emphasize the importance of creating branches for different tasks or features.
c. Encourage regular commits, clear commit messages, and pulling changes from the remote repository to stay up to date.

Collaborative Analysis:
a. Teams should collaborate on the data analysis process, with each member focusing on their assigned role.
b. Data cleaning, EDA, modeling, and other tasks should be well-documented within the project repository.
c. Ensure that teams communicate effectively, share progress, and address any challenges or roadblocks.

Final Presentation:
a. Each team should prepare a final presentation or report that summarizes the collaborative data analysis process and its findings.
b. During the presentation, teams should highlight individual contributions and demonstrate the value of teamwork.
