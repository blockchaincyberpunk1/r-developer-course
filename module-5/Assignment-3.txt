Classification Project

Objective: To complete a supervised classification project using R.

Task:
In this assignment, students will work on a comprehensive supervised classification project. They will select a real-world dataset suitable for classification, preprocess the data, build multiple classification models using caret or mlr, evaluate model performance, and present their findings.

Instructions:

Dataset Selection: Instruct students to select a real-world dataset suitable for classification. Encourage them to choose a dataset that aligns with their interests or field of study. The dataset should have a clear target variable for classification.

Data Preprocessing: Students should preprocess the selected dataset. This includes tasks such as handling missing values, feature engineering (if applicable), data scaling, and encoding categorical variables. Emphasize the importance of data cleaning and transformation.

Model Building: Have students build multiple classification models using either the caret or mlr package. They should consider various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting. Encourage them to configure and tune hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation: Instruct students to evaluate the performance of their classification models. They should use appropriate evaluation metrics for classification tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Students should also consider cross-validation for robust evaluation.

Model Comparison: Ask students to compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing model based on the chosen evaluation metrics. They should justify their choice.

Presentation and Report: Students should present their findings in a report or presentation. They should include the following:

Introduction to the dataset and problem.
Data preprocessing steps.
Description of the classification models used.
Model performance evaluation results.
Discussion of practical applications of the classification results.
Visualizations (e.g., ROC curves, confusion matrices) to illustrate model performance.
Documentation: Ensure that students provide clear documentation of their R code, including comments for explanation. They should include the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Submission: Students should submit their report (PDF or Word document) and R code/scripts. Encourage them to adhere to the submission deadline.
