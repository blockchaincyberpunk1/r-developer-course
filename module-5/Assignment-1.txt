Supervised Learning with caret

Objective: To build and evaluate supervised machine learning models using the caret package in R.

Task:
In this assignment, students will practice building and evaluating supervised machine learning models using the caret package in R. They will work with a labeled dataset suitable for supervised learning, split the data into training and testing sets, and train multiple models to compare their performance.

Instructions:

Dataset Selection: Provide students with a labeled dataset suitable for supervised learning. Depending on the course's focus, the dataset can be for classification or regression tasks. Encourage them to choose a dataset that interests them or relates to their field of study.

Data Splitting: Instruct students to split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. The typical split ratio is 70-80% for training and 20-30% for testing, but this can vary based on dataset size and preferences.

Model Selection: Ask students to choose a variety of supervised machine learning algorithms available in the caret package. Suggest including at least three different types of models, such as decision trees, random forests, and linear regression.

Model Training: Have students train each selected model using the training dataset. They should configure the models and use appropriate settings for each algorithm.

Model Evaluation: Instruct students to evaluate the models using appropriate performance metrics based on the type of task:

For Classification: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
For Regression: Metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Comparison and Selection: Have students compare and contrast the performance of different models based on the evaluation metrics. Ask them to select the best-performing model for the given task.

Results and Analysis: In their report or presentation, students should include:

Introduction and background information about the dataset and task.
Data preprocessing steps, if any.
Details of the models selected, including configuration.
Evaluation results, including performance metrics.
A comparison of model performances and a justification for the chosen model.
Visualizations (e.g., ROC curves, scatter plots) if applicable.
Interpretation of the results and insights gained from the analysis.
Documentation: Students should provide clear documentation of their R code, including comments for explanation. Ensure that they include the code for data splitting, model training, and evaluation.

Submission: Students should submit their report (PDF or Word document) and R code/scripts. Encourage them to adhere to the submission deadline.
