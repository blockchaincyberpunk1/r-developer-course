Regression Project

Objective: To complete a supervised regression project using R.

Task:
In this assignment, students will work on a comprehensive supervised regression project. They will select a real-world dataset suitable for regression, preprocess the data, build regression models using caret or mlr, assess model predictive accuracy, and provide insights into the regression results.

Instructions:

Dataset Selection: Instruct students to select a real-world dataset suitable for regression. Encourage them to choose a dataset that aligns with their interests or field of study. The dataset should include a target variable for regression, such as predicting housing prices, stock prices, or any other continuous outcome.

Data Preprocessing: Students should preprocess the selected dataset. This includes tasks such as handling missing values, feature selection, data scaling, and encoding categorical variables. Emphasize the importance of data cleaning and transformation.

Model Building: Have students build regression models using either the caret or mlr package. They should consider various regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, and gradient boosting. Encourage them to configure and tune hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation: Instruct students to evaluate the performance of their regression models. They should use appropriate evaluation metrics for regression tasks, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. Students should also consider cross-validation for robust evaluation.

Model Comparison: Ask students to compare the performance of different regression models and select the best-performing model based on the chosen evaluation metrics. They should justify their choice.

Insights and Interpretation: Encourage students to provide insights and interpretations of the regression results. This includes understanding the impact of different features on the target variable and discussing practical applications of the regression model.

Presentation and Report: Students should present their findings in a report or presentation. They should include the following:

Introduction to the dataset and regression problem.
Data preprocessing and feature selection steps.
Description of the regression models used.
Model performance evaluation results.
Insights and interpretations of the regression results.
Discussion of practical applications of the regression model.
Visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, regression plots) to illustrate model performance.
Documentation: Ensure that students provide clear documentation of their R code, including comments for explanation. They should include the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Submission: Students should submit their report (PDF or Word document) and R code/scripts. Encourage them to adhere to the submission deadline.
