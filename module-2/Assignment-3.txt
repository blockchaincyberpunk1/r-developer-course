Data Reshaping with tidyr

Objective: To practice data reshaping tasks using the tidyr package.

Task:
In this assignment, students will focus on data reshaping using the tidyr package in R. They will be provided with a wide-format dataset and will need to load the dataset into R, use tidyr functions (e.g., pivot_longer, pivot_wider, gather, spread) to reshape the data into a more suitable format, and explain the importance of data reshaping in real-world data analysis.

Instructions:

Provide students with a wide-format dataset (in a downloadable format, e.g., CSV) that requires data reshaping.

Instruct students to perform the following data reshaping tasks using the tidyr package:
a. Load the provided wide-format dataset into R using appropriate functions (e.g., read.csv or read.table).

b. Utilize tidyr functions to reshape the data as necessary. Depending on the dataset, this may involve:

Converting from wide to long format (pivot_longer, gather).
Converting from long to wide format (pivot_wider, spread).
Separating or uniting columns to restructure the data.
c. Ensure that the reshaped dataset is in a format that is more suitable for analysis, visualization, or further data processing.

Encourage students to provide explanations or comments within their R script regarding the importance of data reshaping. They should explain why the initial wide format was less suitable for analysis and how the reshaped data enhances its usability.

Ask students to consider and document any challenges or considerations they encountered during the reshaping process, such as handling missing data or dealing with multiple variables.

Instruct students to provide a written report that includes the reshaped dataset and explanations of the reshaping process. The report should emphasize the significance of data reshaping in real-world data analysis.

Set a deadline for students to complete the tasks and submit their R script/code along with the written report.

Submission:

After completing the tasks, students should submit their R script/code and the written report (PDF or Word document) through the course's assignment submission portal.
