Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2)

Objective: To create more advanced and interactive visualizations using ggplot2.

Task:
In this assignment, students will continue exploring data visualization using the ggplot2 package in R. They will work with a dataset that includes multiple variables and will be challenged to create more advanced and interactive visualizations, including faceted plots, heatmaps, geospatial maps, and interactive elements such as tooltips.

Instructions:

Provide students with a dataset (in a downloadable format, e.g., CSV) that contains multiple variables and is suitable for advanced visualizations.

Instruct students to perform the following tasks using ggplot2:
a. Load the provided dataset into R using appropriate functions (e.g., read.csv or read.table).

b. Use ggplot2 to create the following advanced and interactive visualizations:

Faceted plots: Visualize data facets using facets_grid or facets_wrap to show subsets of data in separate panels.
Heatmaps: Create heatmaps to display relationships between variables or patterns in the data.
Geospatial maps: Plot data on a map using geographic coordinates and appropriate map layers.
c. Utilize ggplot2 extensions, if necessary, to enhance visualizations. For example, students can use gganimate for creating animated plots or other ggplot2 extensions for additional features.

d. Explain how to add interactive elements to plots for user engagement. Students should demonstrate how tooltips, interactivity on mouse hover, or click actions can be added to their visualizations.

Encourage students to provide explanations or comments within their R script regarding the insights gained from each visualization. They should interpret the visualizations and provide meaningful observations or conclusions.

Ask students to consider the appropriateness of each type of visualization for the dataset they are working with. How do these advanced visualizations enhance data understanding?

Instruct students to create a written report that includes the advanced and interactive visualizations, explanations of insights, and details on how interactive elements were implemented.

Set a deadline for students to complete the tasks and submit their R script/code along with the written report.

Submission:

After completing the tasks, students should submit their R script/code and the written report (PDF or Word document) through the course's assignment submission portal.
