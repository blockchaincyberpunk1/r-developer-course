Model Interpretability and Explainability

Objective: To understand and explain the predictions made by a machine learning model.

Task:
In this assignment, students will gain insight into how their machine learning model makes predictions by exploring model interpretability and explainability techniques. They will select a predictive model they built in a previous assignment, apply relevant interpretability techniques, analyze and visualize the explanations, and discuss the practical implications of model explainability.

Instructions:

Model Selection:
a. Students should select a predictive model they built in a previous assignment (preferably from Assignment 3).
b. Ensure that they have access to both the model and the dataset used for training and testing.

Model Interpretability Techniques:
a. Introduce students to various model interpretability techniques, such as feature importance scores, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), or any other relevant methods.
b. Instruct students to choose one or more techniques based on the type of their selected model and data.

Applying Interpretability Techniques:
a. Ask students to apply the selected interpretability techniques to their model.
b. Encourage them to calculate feature importances or SHAP values for each prediction in the test dataset.

Analysis and Visualization:
a. Guide students in analyzing and visualizing the results of their interpretability techniques. They should:

Identify which features are most influential in making predictions.
Explore how the model's predictions change as certain features vary.
Visualize the explanations using appropriate plots and charts.
Model Explanation Report:
a. Instruct students to create a report detailing their model explanations. The report should include:

A description of the selected interpretability technique(s).
A summary of key findings and insights from the explanations.
Visualizations to support their analysis.
An explanation of how understanding model decisions can be valuable in real-world applications.
Real-World Implications:
a. Encourage students to discuss the practical implications of model explainability in their report. They should consider how these insights could be used in decision-making processes or model improvements.
