Building a Predictive Model

Objective: To develop a complete predictive model from start to finish.

Task:
In this assignment, students will build a predictive model from scratch, starting with data preprocessing and ending with model evaluation and reporting. They will select a predictive modeling problem, prepare the dataset, choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm, train the model, evaluate its performance, fine-tune it if necessary, and present the results in a comprehensive report.

Instructions:

Problem Selection:
a. Instruct students to choose a predictive modeling problem based on their interests or a real-world scenario. Possible problem types include binary classification (e.g., predicting customer churn), multi-class classification, or regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
b. Encourage them to find a dataset related to their chosen problem. They can use publicly available datasets, data from Kaggle, or collect their own data if feasible.

Data Preprocessing and Preparation:
a. Guide students to perform data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. This step should be a continuation of Assignment 2.
b. Emphasize the importance of splitting the data into training and testing sets, maintaining data integrity throughout.

Model Selection:
a. Introduce students to various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or other relevant algorithms based on the problem type.
b. Instruct them to select an appropriate algorithm for their problem. They should justify their choice based on the nature of the problem and dataset.

Model Training:
a. Ask students to train their selected model using the training dataset.
b. Encourage them to fine-tune hyperparameters, if necessary, to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation:
a. Instruct students to evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using relevant evaluation metrics. For classification problems, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are relevant. For regression, metrics like RMSE and R-squared can be used.
b. Require them to provide detailed interpretations of the evaluation results.

Fine-Tuning:
a. If the model's performance is suboptimal, students should explore fine-tuning techniques, such as adjusting hyperparameters, feature selection, or trying different algorithms.
b. Encourage them to document their fine-tuning process and explain the rationale behind each change.

Reporting:
a. Ask students to prepare a comprehensive report summarizing their entire modeling process. The report should include:

Problem statement and dataset description.
Data preprocessing and feature engineering details.
Model selection and justification.
Model training and fine-tuning.
Model evaluation with clear interpretations.
Insights gained from the modeling process.
b. Students should use clear and concise language, providing figures and tables to support their findings.
Presentation:
a. Optionally, students can give a brief presentation of their modeling process and results to the class.
