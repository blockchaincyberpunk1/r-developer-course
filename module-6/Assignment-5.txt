Comparing Models and Ensemble Learning

Objective: To compare different machine learning models and explore ensemble methods.

Task:
In this assignment, students will gain experience in comparing the performance of various machine learning models and exploring ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy. They will select a predictive modeling problem, implement multiple machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and delve into ensemble techniques. The assignment aims to deepen their understanding of model selection and ensemble learning.

Instructions:

Problem and Dataset Selection:
a. Students should choose a predictive modeling problem of interest.
b. They should select an appropriate dataset relevant to the chosen problem. The dataset should include features and a target variable.

Model Implementation and Comparison:
a. Instruct students to implement at least three different machine learning models. Suggested models could include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM)
b. Each model should be trained and tested on the same dataset.
c. Ensure that students use appropriate preprocessing techniques such as data scaling or one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Model Evaluation:
a. Ask students to evaluate each model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics depending on the nature of the problem (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, RMSE).
b. They should provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

Ensemble Methods:
a. Introduce students to ensemble methods, including bagging (e.g., Random Forest) and boosting (e.g., AdaBoost).
b. Instruct them to implement at least one ensemble method of their choice and compare its performance to individual models.
c. Encourage them to explain how ensemble methods work and why they might improve predictive accuracy.

Report and Discussion:
a. Students should prepare a report summarizing their findings and analysis.
b. The report should include:

Model descriptions and implementation details.
Performance metrics for individual models and the ensemble method.
Visualizations (e.g., ROC curves, confusion matrices).
A discussion of the advantages and trade-offs of different models and ensemble techniques.
Insights into which models are most suitable for the given problem.
