Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective: To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset using R.

Task:
In this assignment, students will engage in exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a publicly available dataset of their choice. They will learn how to load, clean, and explore data, create various visualizations, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

Instructions:

Dataset Selection: Instruct students to choose a publicly available dataset from sources like Kaggle, government data repositories, or other relevant sources. Encourage them to select a dataset related to their interests or domain of study.

Data Loading: Ask students to load the chosen dataset into R. They should use appropriate R packages (e.g., readr, read.csv) to read the data.

Data Cleaning: Guide students in handling data preprocessing tasks, including:

Handling missing values: Identify and address missing data appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
Outlier detection and treatment: Identify outliers and decide whether to adjust or remove them.
EDA Process: Instruct students to perform EDA by:

Creating summary statistics: Calculate and display key statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for relevant variables.
Visualization: Encourage students to create various types of visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar charts, and heatmaps, to explore data distribution and relationships.
Hypothesis testing (if applicable): If there are specific hypotheses related to the dataset, guide students on how to perform hypothesis tests to validate or refute those hypotheses.
Insights and Patterns: Ask students to identify interesting patterns, correlations, and insights from the data. They should explore relationships between variables, detect trends, and consider potential implications.

Report or Presentation: Students should present their EDA findings in a report or presentation. The report should include:

Introduction to the dataset and its context.
Data loading and cleaning procedures.
Summary statistics and key visualizations.
Interpretation of insights and patterns discovered.
Conclusions and potential recommendations based on EDA results.
Data Privacy and Ethics: Remind students to respect data privacy and ethical considerations when working with datasets, especially if they contain sensitive information.

Submission: Students should submit their report (PDF or Word document) and any relevant R scripts or notebooks used in the analysis.
